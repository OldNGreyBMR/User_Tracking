Notes being considered for modification of this plug-in as captured from the plug-in forum:

Incorporate new country images (smaller file size); however, include a switch to control which type of image to load, because the images may be of a different file extension.  Also would want a check to validate that at least one type exists.


Images could potentially be reduced by gathering them from: http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/

a newer processor is needed to support geo information available from: http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb.gz

Consideration being given to reworking the path content captured which would likely modify the data table structure.
