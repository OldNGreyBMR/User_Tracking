Notes being considered for modification of this plug-in as captured from the plug-in forum:

Add if you want to track admin pages viewed add the following to the end of /admin/includes/footer.php

<?php if (ADMIN_CONFIG_USER_TRACKING == 'true' && function_exists('zen_update_user_tracking')) { zen_update_user_tracking(); } ?> 


Timezone:
For figuring out the time that suits your timezone just remove 28800 and check what is displayed then. Keep in mind 28800 seconds is 8 hours, figuring out the right time instead (in seconds) should be easy.

My server is hosted in New York, converting 0 with date gave me 19:00:00 and adding 8 hours gave me a 3 hours offset. So I added 5 hours only and it worked fine.

I don't remember having this problem before, I upgraded the mod to the latest version before Christmas at the same time when my provider moved to PHP 5.x (from 4.x) so I am not sure which one causes the problem.

I don't have a general solution, all I know date('H:i:s', mktime(0, 0, 0)) gives me 00:00:00. A general solution needs more work.

There are a other timezone issues as well, I always would have liked an option to set the user timezone as well so that the Start and End times can be in the timezone of the person who runs the mod in the Admin interface. 

Listing items:
When i open User Tracking, by default it opens me the first user that was recorded without a session_id.
In my case web crawlers as google, yahoo....
This may be only particular to me as i have in config-> Sessions :
Prevent Spider Sessions
Prevent known spiders from starting a session = True
And they have a lot of hits in one day > 5000
it is a headache to scroll to the real users sessions through so many hits

the solution is that in admin/user_tracking.php around the end there is the line that shows the clicks off a certain user, for me this line returns true by default in the case of spiders as they don't have session IDs.
line 363 in my file

Code:
if ($_GET['viewsession'] == $ut['value']['session_id']){
  while (($pu = each($ut['value']['last_page_url']))&&($du = each($ut['value']['page_desc'])))
  {and replaced it with (added code in red and bold)

Code:
if ($_GET['viewsession'] == $ut['value']['session_id']  && $ut['value']['session_id'] != ''){
  while (($pu = each($ut['value']['last_page_url']))&&($du = each($ut['value']['page_desc'])))
  {in this way even if the variable is a record without session_id, it does not open by default, only when you click on [view session]

Best regards Zoli. 

Delete records: At the top of the User Tracking page where I have 
Delete all info from IP-Address 66.249.71.141, 67.195.37.98 purge all records 
Clicking it doesn't remove the Yahoo records.  Supposedly this is incorporated into program where an explode was used.  recent updater has not verified it's use/functionality.

When only the Google bot was listed 
Delete all info from IP-Address 66.249.71.141 purge all records 
clicking on the ;purge all records link removed the record of Google visits. 

In instructions identify how to block multiple ip addresses as identified above. 


Finally I've found the solution to my problems with the HTTP 500 error. Just add If-conditions to two of the functions in the geoip.inc file, located in <admin>\includes\

It's the second solution in this posting:
http://razvantudorica.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/cannot-redeclare-geoip_country_code_by_name/

Need to ensure to capture/address malformed page requests.

Images could potentially be reduced by gathering them from: http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/

geo information available from: http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb.gz
Supposedly need a new interpretter and method of interpretation.
