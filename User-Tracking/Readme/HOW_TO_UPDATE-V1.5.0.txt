SQL Added for Dropdown Link Under Tools Section

UPDATING INSTRUCTIONS:

If updating from previous versions 1.3.9h etc. Remove the following files from the admin for V 1.5.0 new navigation method

admin --> includes --> boxes --> extra_boxes --> user_tracking_tools_dhtml.php

UPDATED 06/15/2013

Added ability to hide/show spider visits using the spiders.txt file of Zen Cart.  Default view is to hide spider visits.
Modified the information shown at the bottom of the view to show the number of users and number of bots/spiders that have visited.  This spider/bot information will show whether the actual visit is or is not shown.  Also incorporated modifications published in the Thread related to display of the Idle time of a visitor.  (Previous calculations lead to incorrect display depending on timezone.)

UPDATING INSTRUCTIONS:

Similar updating instructions as previous for updating from earlier Zen Cart version, if updating from Version 1.4.0 of User Tracking, then need to only replace/update the admin/user_tracking.php file.

Enjoy....
